# Conflict Resolution Brief

Your sole job is to resolve git conflict markers in the listed files, stage each resolved file, and report success.
Do NOT commit.
Do NOT run `git merge --continue` — the SKILL does that after receiving `{"status":"success"}`.

## Task intent

These excerpts describe what THIS branch is trying to accomplish.
When the merge introduces a parent-side change that conflicts with this branch's intent, the resolution preserves THIS branch's intent.
In particular: if a file appears under a batch's `Deletes:` list and the merge introduces a modified version of that file from the parent, the resolution is to delete the file (your branch's intent overrides).
Stage the deletion with `git -C /home/knatte/Code/quarry/wts/facade-cli-resolve-expand rm <file>`.



## Conflicting files

- `internal/cli/cli.go`
- `internal/repopath/target.go`

## Instructions

For each file listed above:

1. Read the file and locate every conflict block (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`).
2. Understand both sides of the conflict — what each branch intended.
3. Write a resolution that preserves the intent of both sides.
   When both sides modify **different, non-overlapping parts** of the same conflict region — for example, different columns of one table row, different keys of one object, or disjoint lines of a prose block — **combine both edits** into a single resolved structure.
   Do NOT pick one side wholesale just because the region overlaps syntactically;
   picking one side wholesale is correct only when the two changes are genuinely mutually exclusive (e.g. the same key is renamed to two different values).
   Worked example: if `ours` changes column A and `theirs` changes column B of the same table row, the resolution keeps both column changes in a single row — it does not discard either.
4. Before keeping content from either side inside a conflict hunk, search the rest of the file (outside the hunk) for that same content.
   This judgment call is scoped narrowly — it applies only when a hunk's content might be a moved duplicate of content living elsewhere in the file;
   it does NOT apply to every ordinary step-3 disjoint-region combine (e.g. the column-A/column-B worked example above), which remains today's silent, high-confidence success path.
   Two branches:
   - **Confident case:** if the content clearly already exists elsewhere and the surrounding context makes it unambiguous that this is the same item having been moved (not two independent, separately-intended copies) — do not re-add it in the hunk;
     keep only the other side's unrelated edit.
     Worked example: one side moves a roadmap item from `## Planned` to `## Done`, while the other side makes an unrelated edit elsewhere in the file.
     The resolution keeps the item only under `## Done`;
     it is not re-added under `## Planned`.
   - **Ambiguous case:** if you cannot confidently tell whether this is the same moved content or a legitimate independent duplication — fall back to step 3's default (keep both) rather than guessing, and report the ambiguity via the `discarded` field (see Report section) with the description `"kept both sides of a conflict, ambiguous move-vs-duplicate"`.
     Worked example: a similarly-worded item appears in two different sections and you cannot tell whether it is the same item moved or a legitimate second, independently-added item.
     The resolution keeps both occurrences and reports the ambiguity via `discarded`.
5. Run `git -C /home/knatte/Code/quarry/wts/facade-cli-resolve-expand add <file>` to stage the resolved file.
6. For modify/delete (DU) conflicts: if Task intent above lists this file under a batch's `Deletes:`, run `git -C /home/knatte/Code/quarry/wts/facade-cli-resolve-expand rm <file>` instead of editing;
   that stages the intentional deletion.
7. For UD conflicts — files this branch **modified** that the parent branch **deleted**: do not silently keep the modification.
   Instead: a. Run `git log --diff-filter=D --oneline MERGE_HEAD -- <file>` to find the deletion commit on the parent. b. Run `git show <deletion-commit>` to inspect context. c. If the deletion commit message mentions a replacement file (e.g. "replaced by", "moved to", "consolidated into"),
   or the commit also adds a file in the same directory with overlapping content: stage the deletion — `git -C /home/knatte/Code/quarry/wts/facade-cli-resolve-expand rm <file>`. d. If detection is inconclusive: report `{"status":"stuck","stuck_type":"logic","reason":"modify/delete conflict on <file>: cannot determine if parent deletion is a replacement -- operator must decide"}` and halt.
   Do NOT silently keep the modification.
8. Before reporting `{"status":"success"}` (with or without `discarded`), re-read each file listed in Conflicting files in full and explicitly verify no contradictory losing-side claims survive the resolution — e.g. a stale value from one side of the conflict left alongside the correct value from the other side, or a claim that only made sense before the other side's edit was applied.
   If you find a contradiction you missed, fix it before reporting.
   If you find a contradiction you cannot confidently resolve, report `{"status":"stuck","stuck_type":"logic","reason":"self-verification found an unresolved contradiction in <file>: <description>"}` instead of `{"status":"success"}`.

Never use `git checkout --ours` or `git checkout --theirs` — they silently discard one side of the conflict.

## Report

Your last output line MUST be a bare JSON object (no code fence, no backticks):

On success (nothing discarded):

{"status":"success"}

On success with discarded content — if you had to drop content from one side (e.g. two sides made mutually exclusive changes and only one could survive), list each dropped item:

{"status":"success","discarded":["<short description of what was dropped from which side>"]}

An empty or absent `discarded` field means nothing was lost.
If anything was discarded, you MUST list it;
an empty list when content was actually dropped is a protocol violation. `discarded` also carries the step 4 ambiguous-case entry `"kept both sides of a conflict, ambiguous move-vs-duplicate"` — even though nothing was technically dropped in that case, the field's purpose is to surface anything the operator should double-check before `git merge --continue`, which covers both a genuine drop and a kept-both ambiguity.
The `mill-merge-in` frontend reads this field and surfaces any losses (or ambiguities) to the operator before continuing, rather than silently running `git merge --continue`.

If you cannot resolve one or more conflicts:

{"status":"stuck","stuck_type":"logic","reason":"<one-line description of what you could not resolve>"}

Anything other than this JSON object on the last line is a protocol violation;
the merge-in dispatcher treats that as stuck_type: logic with reason "no structured report" — your work is lost.
Do not wrap the JSON in a code fence;
do not add commentary after it.
