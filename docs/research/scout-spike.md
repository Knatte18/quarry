# Structured Go reference/call-graph lookup — spike findings

**Task:** `codeintel-spike`.
**Date:** 2026-07-17.
**Machine:** Linux x86_64, 12 cores, 30GiB RAM.
**Toolchain:** `go version go1.26.0 linux/amd64`, `golang.org/x/tools/gopls v0.23.0` (installed live via `go install golang.org/x/tools/gopls@latest` — the network fetch succeeded, so no gopls arm degraded to docs-only characterization).
Target module: this repo, `github.com/Knatte18/loomyard`, ~47 `internal/` packages plus `cmd/`/`tools/`.

**Verdict up front:**

- **Direct references / call hierarchy: ADOPT** — `go/packages`+`go/types` in-process is cheap (sub-second warm-up, sub-5ms steady-state, no separate process) and, for the `refs` mechanism (type-checker `Uses`/`Defs` resolution), had **zero false negatives and zero false positives** across all 5 benchmark categories.
  The `callers` (call hierarchy) prototype in this harness has one **real, disqualifying-per-rubric bug** — it misses every call to a generic function invoked with explicit type arguments (100% false-negative rate on `state.ReadJSON`) — but the fix is well-understood and narrow (resolve callees via `TypesInfo.Uses` on the identifier, the way `refs` already does, rather than pattern-matching `*ast.CallExpr.Fun`'s outer AST shape).
  **A follow-up production implementation must build call-hierarchy the same `Uses`/`Defs`-resolved way `refs` does, not the way this prototype's `callers.go` does.**
- **Transitive impact (callgraph): DEFER.**
  CHA and RTA are unusable on this repo — both over-approximate a niche method's transitive callers by two to three orders of magnitude (thousands of functions for a target with 1–25 direct callers).
  VTA is far more precise and **sound on the hand-verified anchor** (misses no real caller) but still carries bounded, explainable false positives from this repo's shared CLI-command-wrapper pattern (`internal/clihelp.WrapRun`), which conflates sibling commands' entry points into the transitive set.
  Direct call-hierarchy is the sweet spot;
  transitive analysis is not worth building now — revisit if a future consumer specifically needs multi-hop impact and can afford a root-set redesign to cut the wrapper-conflation noise.
- **CC-native LSP tool: characterized, not measured live** — architectural mismatch recorded below;
  not a candidate for the orchestrator-driven use case regardless of its precision, since it is an interactive-LLM-chooses-to-call-it capability, not one the Go orchestrator can invoke deterministically.

## Method

Every mechanism was driven through the throwaway harness at `tools/codeintel-poc/` (`go run ./tools/codeintel-poc -mode=<mode> -symbol=<spec> ...`; see `main.go`'s `-help` text for the full flag/spec surface). Each symbol's `refs`/`callers` run recorded a **warm-up** (one-time module load, `packages.Load` with `Tests: false`) and **steady-state** (`n=5` repeated queries against the already-loaded packages, in the same process) separately, per the run-scoped warm-host model (see below). `gopls-refs` (held-open LSP subprocess) recorded warm-up as spawn+`initialize`+first query and steady-state as `n-1` further queries over the same connection; `gopls-cli-refs` (fresh `gopls references ...` process per call) recorded every call as effectively-warm-up since the CLI form never persists state between invocations. `callgraph` recorded SSA-build time and per-algorithm analysis time separately, for `-algo=cha|rta|vta`. Raw JSON output for every run above is under `.scratch/codeintel/` (gitignored, not part of this commit, per Shared Decision `measurement-artifacts-to-scratch`); the tables below are the distilled result.

**Harness source (preserved in git history).**
The throwaway harness was deleted in batch 4 (revert commit `d4dcb31c`) so this branch's product diff against `main` is doc-only.
Its full, tested source is preserved in git history at `d4dcb31c^` = **`3b4dcf86`** (the last commit before the revert): `tools/codeintel-poc/{main, gopackages,callers,gopls,callgraph}.go` plus the repo-root `.lsp.json`.
Recover a single file with `git show 3b4dcf86:tools/codeintel-poc/gopackages.go`, or check out the whole harness with `git checkout 3b4dcf86 -- tools/codeintel-poc .lsp.json`.
The same tree is also reachable via the `codeintel-spike` archive tag `mill-merge` creates when this task lands.

**Ground truth** for the precision table was established by hand: `grep`-ing every non-test call site of each benchmark symbol across the module and manually excluding false grep matches (e.g. a doc-comment mentioning the symbol's name), then diffing that hand-built set's *count* against the harness's reported count (the harness always returned the exact position list too, spot-checked per symbol, not just counted).

## Benchmark symbols

Chosen per `_mill/discussion.md` → `benchmark-symbols`;
full selection rationale and fan-in survey in `.scratch/codeintel/symbols.md`.

| # | Category | Symbol |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Interface satisfaction | `shuttleengine.Engine.Prepare` (interface method) vs. `claudeengine.Claude.Prepare` (its one real implementer) |
| 2 | Generics | `state.WriteJSON[T]` / `state.ReadJSON[T]` |
| 3 | High fan-in plain function | `hubgeometry.Resolve` (25 production references — the actual highest-fan-in hubgeometry function surveyed, beating `Getwd`=21, `ConfigFile`=16) |
| 4 | Method with many call sites | `hubgeometry.Layout.WeftWorktree` (17 production call sites) |
| 5 | Reflection-adjacent / negative case | `output.Err` / `output.Ok` (173 / 49 production call sites; JSON envelope built from `map[string]any` via `encoding/json`'s reflection-based `Marshal`) |

## Cost table (warm-up once-per-run + per-query steady-state, ms)

| mechanism | warm-up (ms, range across symbols) | steady-state median (ms, range) |
|---|---:|---:|
| `go/packages` in-process, `refs` | 489–640 | 0.32–0.66 |
| `go/packages` in-process, `callers` | 490–563 | 2.03–4.29 |
| `gopls` held-open LSP, first query | 175–392 | 3.29–19.0 |
| `gopls` cold CLI, per call | 190–1276 | 201–1765 (every call pays the load — "warm-up" and "steady-state" converge, confirming the discussion's "cold every time" prediction for the CLI form) |
| `callgraph` (SSA build + analysis, CHA/RTA/VTA) | build 190–248 | analysis: CHA 135–149, RTA 87–90, VTA 381–407 (all one-shot per query, no repeat-query steady-state concept for this mode) |

**Both load-bearing numbers land comfortably inside the rubric's bar**: warm-up is a few hundred milliseconds (well under the rubric's "order of a few seconds" ceiling), steady-state is sub-5ms for every in-process mode (`refs` sub-millisecond) — both trivially "effectively free relative to an LLM turn."
The gopls-held-open comparison is similarly cheap but strictly slower than in-process at every step (spawn + LSP framing overhead) and requires supervising an external subprocess for the run's duration — no efficiency reason to prefer it over in-process here.
The gopls **CLI** form is the one mechanism that fails the cost bar outright: with no held-open state, every call pays the full load, ~200ms–1.8s per query — usable for a one-shot check, not for a run needing many queries.

## Precision table (per symbol, vs. hand-verified ground truth)

| symbol | mode | ground truth (production call sites) | harness result | false neg | false pos |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `hubgeometry.Resolve` | refs | 24 calls (+1 def = 25) | 25 | 0 | 0 |
| `hubgeometry.Resolve` | callers | 24 | 24 | 0 | 0 |
| `hubgeometry.Layout.WeftWorktree` | refs | 17 calls (+1 def = 18) | 18 | 0 | 0 |
| `hubgeometry.Layout.WeftWorktree` | callers | 17 | 17 | 0 | 0 |
| `state.WriteJSON` | refs | 6 calls (+1 def = 7) | 7 | 0 | 0 |
| `state.WriteJSON` | callers | 6 | 6 | 0 | 0 |
| `state.ReadJSON` | refs | 6 calls (+1 def = 7) | 7 | 0 | 0 |
| `state.ReadJSON` | callers | 6 | **0** | **6 (100%)** | 0 |
| `output.Err` | refs | 173 calls (+1 def = 174) | 174 | 0 | 0 |
| `output.Err` | callers | 173 | 173 | 0 | 0 |
| `output.Ok` | refs | 49 calls (+1 def = 50) | 50 | 0 | 0 |
| `output.Ok` | callers | 49 | 49 | 0 | 0 |
| `shuttleengine.Engine.Prepare` | refs | 1 call (+1 def = 2), production only | 2 | 0 | 0 |
| `claudeengine.Claude.Prepare` | refs | 0 production calls (+1 def = 1) | 1 | 0 | 0 |

**The one real bug** (`state.ReadJSON`, `callers` mode): `state.ReadJSON`'s type parameter cannot be inferred from its arguments (`path, lockPath string`;
`T` only appears in the return type), so every real call site uses explicit instantiation syntax — `state.ReadJSON[RunState](path, lockPath)`. `callers.go`'s `resolveCallee` only type-switches `call.Fun` on `*ast.Ident` / `*ast.SelectorExpr`;
a generic instantiation's `call.Fun` is instead an `*ast.IndexExpr` (single type arg) wrapping one of those, which the switch's `default` case silently drops, resolving to no callee at all. `refs` mode is unaffected because it walks `TypesInfo.Uses`/`Defs` directly (the type checker already resolved the identifier inside the `IndexExpr` regardless of the wrapping AST shape) — which is why the recommended production fix is "build call-hierarchy on `Uses`/`Defs` like `refs` does," not "special-case `IndexExpr` in the AST walk": the `Uses`/`Defs` approach is categorically immune to this whole class of bug.

**Interface satisfaction — zero production false negatives,
but a real latent gap demonstrated by test code.**
No production code in this repo calls `claudeengine.Claude.Prepare` directly by name — every real call dispatches through the `shuttleengine.Engine` interface value (`claudeengine.New()` is boxed into the interface field immediately at every construction site: `internal/shuttlecli/cli.go:103`, `internal/buildercli/cli.go:204`, `internal/burlercli/cli.go:121`, `internal/perchcli/cli.go:140`), so querying `refs` on the interface method's `types.Object` correctly finds the one real dispatch site and nothing is missed.
But `claudeengine`'s own **test files** call the concrete method directly (`c := New(); c.Prepare(...)`, e.g. `internal/shuttleengine/claudeengine/prepare_test.go:32`) — a `types.Object` distinct from the interface method's, so a `refs` query on `Engine.Prepare` would **not** find those call sites even if the harness loaded test files (it doesn't — `packages.Load` runs with `Tests: false`, a batch-1 harness scope decision, not a fundamental `go/packages` limitation).
This is the real, structural interface-dispatch precision risk the rubric warns about: if a future card's edit called a concrete implementation directly instead of through the interface, `refs`-on-the-interface-method would silently miss it.
It happens not to bite on this repo's *production* code today,
but a production implementation should query **both** the interface method and its known implementers' methods for a `find all callers of this interface method` request, not the interface method alone.

**`gopls` finds more than the in-process arm for the same reason**: `gopls`'s workspace indexes test files by default (its `references` results for `weftworktree`/`writejson`/ `readjson`/`outputerr` were consistently 2–4 entries higher than the in-process `refs` count — the delta is test-file call sites), and (per the interface case above) `gopls` unifies an interface method's references with its implementers' references into one set — querying either `Engine.Prepare` or `Claude.Prepare` returned the identical 11-entry set (2 production + 9 test-file concrete-dispatch calls).
This is a genuine precision **advantage** for `gopls` on the interface case, traded against needing an external binary and being slower per-query than in-process (cost table above).
**Methodological footnote:** `gopls-cli-refs`'s reported count is consistently exactly one less than `gopls-refs`'s for the same symbol (e.g. 24 vs 25 for `Resolve`) — the CLI form defaults `includeDeclaration` to `false` where this harness's LSP client explicitly requests `true`;
not a precision difference, a request-parameter difference.

**Reflection-adjacent case, honest negative result:** `output.Err`/`Ok` were chosen to stress static analysis at a reflection boundary (`encoding/json.Marshal` on a `map[string]any`),
but the actual *call sites* to `Ok`/`Err` themselves are ordinary, statically-resolvable function calls — the reflection happens inside `Marshal` on the map's runtime values, not on the call expression the harness resolves.
Result: **0 false negatives/positives**, an honest confirmation that this particular reflection-adjacent shape does not, in fact, stress this class of tool — the risk reflection poses to static analysis is to *value/field-level* tracking (e.g. `reflect.ValueOf(x).FieldByName(...)`), not to *call-site* resolution,
and this repo has no examples of the former on a convenient benchmark symbol.

## CHA/RTA/VTA divergence

**Callgraph roots** (shared across `rta`/`vta`, `cha` needs none — see `_mill/discussion.md` → `transitive-impact-in-scope`): `cmd/lyx`'s `main.main` (`cmd/lyx/main.go:38`), every loaded package's synthetic `init` (which itself calls each package's explicit `init#N` functions), and any `TestMain` (none present — `Tests: false`).
This is `callgraph.go`'s existing `seedRoots`, unmodified.

| symbol | CHA callers | RTA callers | VTA callers | CHA/VTA ratio | RTA/VTA ratio |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `claudeengine.Claude.Prepare` | 6,759 | 3,803 | 45 | 150× | 85× |
| `hubgeometry.Layout.WeftWorktree` | 6,761 | 3,805 | 54 | 125× | 70× |
| `hubgeometry.WeftHostSlug` (anchor, below) | 6,759 | 3,803 | 30 | 225× | 127× |

CHA and RTA are effectively unusable as a ripple-impact signal on this repo: both report transitive-caller sets in the thousands **regardless of the target** (all three targets above land within ±3 functions of each other on both CHA and RTA, despite having 1, 17, and 1 direct callers respectively) — the transitive closure has already saturated most of the program's reachable call graph a few hops out, which any CLI binary with a shared command-dispatch spine is prone to.
VTA is dramatically tighter (30–54, tracking each target's actual local structure) and cheap (comparable analysis time to CHA/RTA, all under half a second including SSA build).

### Small-symbol soundness anchor: `hubgeometry.WeftHostSlug`

Chosen as the small, shallow (2–3 hop) case: `WeftHostSlug` has exactly one direct call site (`internal/warpengine/prune.go:127`, inside `(*Worktree).Prune`), `Prune` has exactly one direct call site (`internal/warpcli/warp.go:430`, the `pruneCmd`'s `RunE` closure — the 6th `cobra.Command` literal in `warp.go`'s `Command()`, hence VTA's own name for it, `warpcli.Command$6`),
and that closure is wired through the shared `clihelp.WrapRun` → `RunRoot` → `Execute` path every module's `RunCLI` uses, up to `cmd/lyx.main`.
Hand-traced **true chain** (verified against `internal/clihelp/exec.go`, where `RunRoot` calls `cmd.ExecuteContext(ctx)` directly — cobra's own `ExecuteContext` → `Execute` → `ExecuteC` → `execute` delegation chain is therefore a real, exercised link here, not an artifact):

```
WeftHostSlug → Prune → warpcli.runPruneWithFlag → warpcli.Command$6 →
clihelp.WrapRun$1 → (*cobra.Command).execute → (*cobra.Command).ExecuteC →
(*cobra.Command).Execute → (*cobra.Command).ExecuteContext → clihelp.RunRoot →
clihelp.Execute → warpcli.RunCLI → cmd/lyx.main
```

VTA's reported 30-entry set **contains every link of this 12-entry true chain — zero missed real callers, confirming soundness** — but pads it with 18 extra entries: the sibling modules' own `RunCLI` functions (`boardcli.RunCLI`, `buildercli.RunCLI`, `burlercli.RunCLI`, `idecli.RunCLI`, `initcli.RunInit`, `reedcli.RunCLI`, `perchcli.RunCLI`, `selfreportcli.RunCLI`, `shuttlecli.RunCLI`, `weftcli.RunCLI` — 10 functions) plus `configcli`'s own internal call fan-out (`configcli.Command$1`, `configcli.RunCLI`, `configcli.dispatch`, `configcli.editOne`, `configcli.menu`, `configcli.runConfig`, `configcli.runConfig$1`, `configcli.setModule` — 8 functions).
None of these 18 functions' code paths can actually reach `warpcli.runPruneWithFlag` — they are **false positives** caused by every module wrapping its own commands through the same `clihelp.WrapRun` closure shape (`func(io.Writer, []string) int`), which VTA's type-based abstraction cannot fully disambiguate by closure identity once several different closures share that exact signature.
This is the "bounded, explainable false positives" the rubric tolerates — explainable here down to the exact repo pattern causing it — but it is real, present even in VTA (the most precise of the three), and keeps the callgraph sub-verdict at Defer rather than Adopt: an implementer using VTA's transitive result would need to manually discount every unrelated sibling-module entry, undermining "trust it instead of grep" for the transitive case specifically (direct `refs`/`callers` carry no such caveat).

12 (true chain) + 18 (sibling-module false positives) = the full 30-entry `transitive_callers` set in `.scratch/codeintel/weftHostSlug-callgraph-vta.json`.

## Run-scoped warm-host model

Confirmed exactly as designed in `_mill/discussion.md` → `warm-host-model`: the in-process `go/packages` arm needs **no separate process at all** — "warm" is simply the `[]*packages.Package` slice the harness's own `main` process holds in memory after `loadPackages` returns;
a real orchestrator run (`lyx builder run` / a card's implementer session) would load once at run start and query many times across the run's cards, tearing down naturally when the run process exits.
The `gopls`-held-open arm is the same shape one level up — a run-supervised child process, spawned once, queried many times, torn down at run end — never a machine-wide daemon.
The `gopls` **CLI** form (a fresh process per query) is deliberately *not* the warm path;
its cost numbers above confirm the discussion's prediction that it is cold every time and therefore the wrong shape for a run that needs more than one query.

## CC-native LSP tool: architectural mismatch

Per Card 6 (`chore(codeintel-poc): add throwaway .lsp.json + characterize CC-native LSP`), enabling Claude Code's native LSP tool requires `ENABLE_LSP_TOOL=1` set *before* an interactive session starts — this mill-go implementer session could not toggle it on itself mid-session (confirmed via `CLAUDECODE=1`/`CLAUDE_CODE_CHILD_SESSION=1` env, `ENABLE_LSP_TOOL` unset), so per `_mill/discussion.md` → `cc-native-lsp-mismatch`'s Accepted-outcome note, this arm is a **docs-only characterization**, not a live measurement.
The wiring itself (repo-root `.lsp.json` pointing `gopls` at stdio transport, per the recipe below) is in place and `gopls` is confirmed installed and working via the other two arms, so the recipe is runnable by an operator with a fresh session.

**The recipe:** (1) `go install golang.org/x/tools/gopls@latest` so `gopls` resolves on `$PATH`;
(2) a repo-root `.lsp.json` of the shape committed in Card 6;
(3) launch Claude Code with `ENABLE_LSP_TOOL=1` in the process environment before the session starts;
(4) prompt the model to use the LSP tool — it is an **LLM-invoked** capability, not one the harness or an orchestrator can call directly.

**Why this doesn't compete with the other two mechanisms regardless of precision**: loomyard's agent-execution model is the **file contract** — the Go orchestrator invokes a capability, gets a bounded structured result, and folds it into a digest, all before the LLM turn that consumes it starts.
Claude Code's native LSP tool is the opposite shape: an **interactive-LLM-chooses-to-call-it** capability, invoked mid-turn at the model's discretion, with no deterministic, orchestrator-driven call the way `builder`/`webster`/`burler` need.
It answers a different question (an interactive aid available *to* the model during its own turn) than this spike's question (a deterministic, pre-computed impact digest handed *to* the model).
This is why it is measured only as a baseline, never a lead candidate, per the discussion's own framing.

## How-to recipe (adopt-now path: `go/packages`+`go/types` in-process references)

Verified live during this spike (Card 7 step (b), the `refs` runs tabulated above).
Minimal, runnable shape a follow-up production Go verb can lift directly — see `tools/codeintel-poc/gopackages.go` at commit `3b4dcf86` in git history (the full, tested version this recipe is extracted from;
see **Method → Harness source** above for recovery commands):

```go
import (
    "go/token"
    "go/types"
    "golang.org/x/tools/go/packages"
)

// Load once per run (the warm-up tax measured above), hold pkgs in memory for
// the rest of the run.
cfg := &packages.Config{
    Dir:  moduleRoot,
    Mode: packages.NeedName | packages.NeedFiles | packages.NeedSyntax |
        packages.NeedTypes | packages.NeedTypesInfo | packages.NeedDeps |
        packages.NeedImports | packages.NeedModule,
    // Tests: true if a future consumer needs call sites inside _test.go files
    // too — see the interface-satisfaction finding above for why this matters.
}
pkgs, err := packages.Load(cfg, "./...")
// packages.PrintErrors(pkgs) > 0 => treat as a load failure, not a partial result.

// Resolve a symbol to its types.Object (package-level func/type/var, or a
// method — for a method on an INTERFACE type, look up on the named type
// itself, not types.NewPointer(named); pointer-to-interface has no method
// set at all).

// Then, per query (the steady-state cost measured above), walk every loaded
// package's already-computed type info — no re-parsing, no re-type-checking:
for _, pkg := range pkgs {
    for ident, use := range pkg.TypesInfo.Uses {
        if use == targetObj {
            pos := pkg.Fset.Position(ident.Pos()) // file:line:col, ready to hand to the LLM
        }
    }
}
```

**Do not** reuse this task's `callers.go` (syntactic `*ast.CallExpr` scan) for a production call-hierarchy verb — build it on `TypesInfo.Uses`/`Defs` the same way `refs` above does (filter to `Uses` entries whose enclosing declaration is a `*ast.FuncDecl`/`*ast.FuncLit`), which sidesteps the generic-instantiation bug found in this spike entirely rather than patching around it.

## Caveats

One target repo, one machine, one run per arm (`n=5` steady-state repeats per in-process query, `n=3` for `gopls-refs`, `n=2` for `gopls-cli-refs` — enough to distinguish warm-up from steady-state, not a statistically rigorous benchmark;
numbers throughout are order-of-magnitude, matching `docs/benchmarks/` house style). 5 benchmark symbols, hand-picked to stress specific static-analysis edge cases rather than sampled — the generics false-negative and the interface latent-gap findings are exactly the kind of result deliberate stress-case selection exists to surface,
but a different symbol set could surface different edge cases this spike didn't hit.
The callgraph section hand-verified soundness on **one** small anchor, not every symbol — CHA/RTA's numbers are reported as-is (thousands of callers) without a matching hand-enumeration, since that scale is exactly what makes hand-enumeration intractable for anything but the smallest case (the reason the discussion's method treats VTA as the relative reference instead).
No wall-clock comparison against the LLM-driven grep/Read baseline this spike exists to replace is claimed — that would need a separate, real card-implementation comparison, out of scope for a feasibility measurement.
