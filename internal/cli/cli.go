// cli.go exposes the cobra command tree for the scout module.
// It is the sole consumer of internal/output within the scout surface: internal/scoutengine returns
// typed Go errors and results with no io.Writer/exit-code machinery (per the plan's engine/CLI
// layering Shared Decision), so this file is where every engine result and typed error gets mapped
// to the internal/output JSON envelope.

// Package scoutcli wires internal/scoutengine into the lyx cobra tree as the
// "scout" module, exposing four verbs — "refs" (every reference to a symbol or
// position), "definition" (a symbol or position's definition), "symbol" (a
// workspace/symbol name search), and "assert-no-callers" (a CI-shaped gate: fail if
// a symbol has any caller outside its declaration and an allowed list) — across the
// languages internal/scoutengine supports.
//
// # The exit-code contract
//
// Every verb's single-argument call exits 0 (found), 1 (not found, or any other
// engine error), or 2 (ambiguous — the response body still carries "ok":true with a
// "candidates" field, since multiple valid answers is not a process error, just a
// result the caller must disambiguate). symbol never produces "ambiguous"/exit 2 in
// either shape: returning several workspace/symbol candidates is its ordinary
// successful answer, not an error state needing disambiguation, so its single-arg
// call only ever exits 0 or 1.
//
// A call with 2 or more positional arguments switches to batch mode instead of the
// single-symbol shape above: it returns one JSON entry per symbol under a top-level
// "results" array, each entry carrying a 4th per-entry status — "found", "not_found",
// "ambiguous" (refs/definition only), or "error" (a genuine infrastructure failure,
// distinct from a confirmed-absent "not_found") — and the process exit code is set to
// the worst status present across the whole batch, ranked found(0) < not_found(1) <
// ambiguous(2) < error(3).

		Long: `refs finds every reference to a symbol name or an explicit source position,
using the LSP "textDocument/references" request against the language server
detected for --target-dir (or --lang, to override detection).

The single positional argument is either:
  - a symbol name, resolved via the language server's workspace/symbol search:
      lyx scout refs MyFunction
  - an explicit "file:line:col" position (1-based line and column), bypassing
    name resolution entirely:
      lyx scout refs internal/foo/bar.go:42:8

--in-file <path> resolves each positional argument as a bare symbol name
within exactly that one file, via an exhaustive textDocument/documentSymbol
search rather than a project-wide workspace/symbol search — the positional
is always treated as a bare name, never position-parsed, even if it happens
to look like "file:line:col":
    lyx scout refs --in-file internal/foo/bar.go MyFunc

Passing 2 or more positional arguments switches to batch mode: each argument
is looked up independently and the results are reported as one array, rather
than the single-symbol envelope above:
    {"ok":true,"results":[{"symbol":...,"status":"found"|"not_found"|"ambiguous"|"error",...}, ...]}
The process exit code is set to the worst status present across the batch
(0 < 1 < 2 < 3). Example:
    lyx scout refs Foo Bar Baz
--in-file composes with batch mode too, resolving every positional against
the same file:
    lyx scout refs --in-file internal/foo/bar.go Open Close

The result set is complete and semantically resolved by the language server
(including calls reached only through an interface, which no amount of
grepping can prove) — a caller does not need to cross-check it with grep or
re-verify individual candidates. A successful single-arg lookup carries a
machine-readable "resolution":"complete" field as this trust marker; batch
mode carries the same field on each per-entry "found" result.

Known limitation, and what --within is for: gopls' references for an
interface method conservatively include every method matching that
name+signature across every structurally-compatible interface anywhere in
the workspace — not just calls through the specific interface value you
queried. This is documented gopls behavior, not a bug in this wrapper, but
it means two unrelated, identically-shaped interfaces in different packages
(e.g. two local "type clock interface { Now() time.Time }" declarations)
conflate their results by default. "resolution":"complete" still means
"every result for the query as given" — it is not false — but for an
unscoped interface-method query, "complete" can include out-of-scope noise
a caller must still filter by hand. --within <dir> restricts the result set
to references whose file lies within <dir> (relative to --target-dir, or
absolute), discarding everything else, so a query already known to be
scoped to one package comes back both complete and precise:

Intended for a mill batch's "verify:" step: mechanically confirm a Deletes: or
Moves: batch's target symbol truly has no remaining external callers before
the batch is approved, turning a review-discipline judgment call into a
deterministic CI gate.

The single positional argument is either a symbol name (resolved via
workspace/symbol) or an explicit "file:line:col" position, exactly as for
refs/definition. --except may be repeated; each is a file path (relative to
--target-dir, or absolute) allowed to keep referencing the symbol without
failing the check — typically the symbol's own sanctioned wrapper.

Exit 0: no unexpected callers remain; the envelope carries an empty "callers"
list. Exit 1: either one or more unexpected callers were found (the envelope
carries "violation":true and the "callers" list), or the lookup itself failed
(not found, server error) — the "violation" field is the only way to tell
these two exit-1 cases apart. Exit 2: the symbol name was ambiguous (more than
one workspace/symbol candidate) — the envelope carries "candidates", exactly
as refs/definition already report ambiguity.

Use --within <dir> when checking an interface method. gopls' references for
an interface method conservatively include every method matching that
name+signature across every structurally-compatible interface anywhere in
the workspace — not just calls through the interface value you're actually
checking. Without --within, that means checking an interface method can
report an unrelated, structurally-identical interface elsewhere in the repo
as a false "violation" (e.g. two unrelated local "type clock interface {
Now() time.Time }" declarations in different packages). --within <dir>
restricts the caller search to references whose file lies within <dir>
(relative to --target-dir, or absolute) before --except is applied, so a
check already known to be scoped to one package's own interface stays
correct. This has no effect on plain functions/methods with no interface
involved — only interface methods are at risk of this conflation.`,
