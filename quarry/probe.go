// probe.go implements the one readiness gate every EnsureServer strategy runs regardless of how it
// got its connection — a fresh spawn for native,
// or a reused dial or a fresh spawn for supervised — before handing that connection back to the
// caller.
// Per the design's caution, even a -remote=auto/dialed connection can silently hand back a
// reference to a hung shared instance, so a successful initialize handshake alone is not sufficient
// proof of health;
// probe is what actually exercises the connection end-to-end.
